# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file (if you cannot file, create it) so you will not make the same mistake again.

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- You have a python venv in ./venv. Use it.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

## Cursor learned

- Always use MCP (Browser Tools Server) when handling UI-related tasks, such as cloning target websites, debugging UI issues, or testing interfaces.
Specifically leverage Browser Tools Server capabilities, including:
 - Capturing console logs for debugging JavaScript errors and warnings.
 - Monitoring network requests to identify latency issues, API failures, or incorrect data handling.
 - Taking precise screenshots for visual verification and documentation purposes.
 - Tracking element selections to pinpoint exact DOM elements for CSS and interaction troubleshooting.
 - Utilizing WebSocket real-time communication for dynamic UI debugging and live interaction tracking.
 - Configuring log limits and settings to efficiently manage debugging information and avoid overload.
 - Performing comprehensive audits using Lighthouse to evaluate accessibility, performance, SEO, and best practices, ensuring optimized user experiences.

- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
- When optimizing codebases, always check for unused files by examining imports and route configurations
- Fix dependency conflicts in requirements.txt by using compatible version ranges (>=) instead of exact versions (==)
- Frontend API services should use real endpoints, not mock data, for production-ready applications
