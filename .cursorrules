## ✅ CSV PARSING FIX COMPLETE!

### Task Overview:
✅ **COMPLETED:** Fixed CSV parsing to properly handle commas within quoted team duty fields

### Issue Identified:
- ❌ **CSV Parsing Problem**: Simple `split(',')` was breaking on commas inside quoted fields
- ❌ **Team Duties Misassignment**: Fields like "Check Queue registration, Game, Stage, Water station" were being split incorrectly
- ❌ **Data Corruption**: Team responsibilities were being assigned to wrong teams due to parsing errors

### Solution Implemented:
- ✅ **Proper CSV Parser**: Created `parseCSVLine()` function that respects quoted fields
- ✅ **Quote Handling**: Correctly processes both single and escaped double quotes
- ✅ **Comma Protection**: Ignores commas inside quoted fields while still using them as separators
- ✅ **Enhanced csvLoader.ts**: Updated both `parseCSV()` and `parseCSVWithHeaders()` functions

### CSV Parsing Logic:
```typescript
// Now correctly handles:
"Operation","Check Queue registration, Game, Stage, Water station"
"Game","Key time for transitions, score check-ins, and Game status confirmation"
"Staff","Coordinate with kitchen, serve drinks, manage waste"
```

### Before vs After:
**BEFORE (Broken):**
- `"Check Queue registration, Game, Stage, Water station"` → `["Check Queue registration", " Game", " Stage", " Water station"]` (4 fields)
- Team duties assigned to wrong teams due to field shifting

**AFTER (Fixed):**
- `"Check Queue registration, Game, Stage, Water station"` → `["Check Queue registration, Game, Stage, Water station"]` (1 field)
- Team duties correctly assigned to intended teams

### Progress:
[X] CSV parsing issue analysis

## ✅ UP NEXT EXPANSION STATE BUG FIX COMPLETE!

### Task Overview:
✅ **COMPLETED:** Fixed expansion state conflict between "UP NEXT" section and complete schedule

### Issue Identified:
- ❌ **Shared State Problem**: UP NEXT and complete schedule were sharing the same `expandedCards` state
- ❌ **Cross-Section Interference**: Clicking expand in UP NEXT would also expand/collapse the same item in complete schedule
- ❌ **User Experience Issue**: Confusing behavior where actions in one section affected another section

### Solution Implemented:
- ✅ **Separate State Variables**: Created `nextEventExpanded` boolean state specifically for UP NEXT section
- ✅ **Independent Toggle Function**: Added `toggleNextEventExpanded()` function for UP NEXT section only
- ✅ **Enhanced UP NEXT UI**: Added team duty preview chips like in NOW HAPPENING section
- ✅ **Isolated Expansion Logic**: UP NEXT section now operates independently from complete schedule

### Technical Implementation:
- ✅ **State Separation**: 
  - `expandedCards: Set<string>` - For complete schedule items
  - `nextEventExpanded: boolean` - For UP NEXT section only
- ✅ **Function Separation**:
  - `toggleExpanded(itemId: string)` - For complete schedule
  - `toggleNextEventExpanded()` - For UP NEXT section
- ✅ **UI Enhancement**: Added duty preview chips in UP NEXT section for consistency with NOW HAPPENING

### Before vs After:
**BEFORE (Buggy):**
- Clicking UP NEXT expand button would also expand/collapse the same event in complete schedule
- User confusion due to unexpected cross-section behavior

**AFTER (Fixed):**
- UP NEXT section has independent expansion state
- Complete schedule expansion works independently
- No cross-section interference

### Enhanced UP NEXT Features:
- ✅ **Team Duty Preview**: Shows team duty chips like NOW HAPPENING section

### ⏱️ **EVENT TIMER SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!**

### Task Overview:
✅ **COMPLETED:** Added TIME REMAINING timer to NOW HAPPENING section of LiveSchedule component

### What Was Implemented:

#### 🔧 **Timer Functionality:**
- ✅ **getTimeRemaining() Function**: Calculates time remaining until current event ends
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Timer updates every minute with the existing timer interval
- ✅ **Format Display**: Shows time in HH:MM format (e.g., "01:23" for 1 hour 23 minutes)
- ✅ **Zero Handling**: Shows "00:00" when event time has passed
- ✅ **AccessTime Icon**: Added clock icon import for visual consistency

#### 🎨 **UI Integration:**
- ✅ **NOW HAPPENING Section**: Timer prominently displayed below event title
- ✅ **Visual Design**: Orange color (#ff9800) matching NOW HAPPENING theme
- ✅ **Typography**: h6 variant with bold weight for prominence
- ✅ **Icon Integration**: AccessTime icon preceding the timer text
- ✅ **Spacing**: Proper spacing with mb: 2 margin below timer

#### 📱 **Display Format:**
```
⏱️ TIME REMAINING: [01:23]
```

#### 🔧 **Technical Implementation:**
- ✅ **Time Calculation**: Uses existing timeToMinutes() function for consistency
- ✅ **Current Time Integration**: Leverages existing currentTime state
- ✅ **Automatic Updates**: Updates with existing 60-second interval timer
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles negative time values
- ✅ **Format Consistency**: Zero-padded hours and minutes display

#### 📦 **Code Changes:**
- ✅ **Import Added**: `AccessTime as AccessTimeIcon` from @mui/icons-material
- ✅ **Function Added**: `getTimeRemaining(endTime: string, currentTime: Date): string`
- ✅ **UI Element Added**: Timer display box in NOW HAPPENING card
- ✅ **Styling Applied**: Orange theme color and proper spacing

### Timer Logic:
```typescript
const getTimeRemaining = (endTime: string, currentTime: Date): string => {
  const endMinutes = timeToMinutes(endTime);
  const currentMinutes = currentTime.getHours() * 60 + currentTime.getMinutes();
  const remainingMinutes = endMinutes - currentMinutes;
  
  if (remainingMinutes <= 0) {
    return "00:00";
  }
  
  const hours = Math.floor(remainingMinutes / 60);
  const minutes = remainingMinutes % 60;
  
  return `${hours.toString().padStart(2, '0')}:${minutes.toString().padStart(2, '0')}`;
};
```

### UI Implementation:
```tsx
{/* Time Remaining Display */}
<Box sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
  <Stack direction="row" alignItems="center" spacing={1}>
    <AccessTimeIcon sx={{ color: '#ff9800' }} />
    <Typography variant="h6" sx={{ fontWeight: 600, color: '#ff9800' }}>
      TIME REMAINING: [{getTimeRemaining(currentEvent.endTime, currentTime)}]
    </Typography>
  </Stack>
</Box>
```

### Progress:
[X] Timer calculation function implementation
[X] AccessTime icon import
[X] UI integration in NOW HAPPENING section
[X] Real-time update integration
[X] Visual styling and formatting
[X] Testing and verification

## 🎉 EVENT TIMER IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!

### 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES**

#### **Event Timer System:**
```typescript
// Timer component in LiveSchedule.tsx
const EventTimer = ({ startTime, endTime, status }) => (
  <Box sx={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', gap: 1 }}>
    <AccessTimeIcon />
    <Typography variant="h6" color={getTimerColor(status)}>
      {formatTimeRemaining(startTime, endTime)}
    </Typography>
    <Chip label={status} color={getStatusColor(status)} size="small" />
  </Box>
);
```

#### **Medical Emergency Response:**
```typescript
// Emergency button in header
const EmergencyButton = () => (
  <IconButton 
    color="error" 
    size="large"
    onClick={handleEmergencyAlert}
    sx={{ 
      backgroundColor: 'error.main',
      color: 'white',
      '&:hover': { backgroundColor: 'error.dark' }
    }}
  >
    <LocalHospitalIcon />
  </IconButton>
);
```

#### **Help Request Button:**
```typescript
// Floating action button
const HelpButton = () => (
  <Fab
    color="secondary"
    aria-label="request help"
    sx={{
