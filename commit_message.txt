[Cursor] Fix Vercel deployment: Implement Vercel KV for venue status updates

🚨 Problem Fixed:
- Vercel serverless functions have read-only file system
- Venue status updates using fs.writeFile() don't work on Vercel
- Implemented Vercel KV (Redis) database solution

🔧 Technical Implementation:
- Replaced file system writes with Vercel KV database operations
- Created new API endpoints for venue management
- Added fallback to CSV loading if KV is unavailable
- Updated venue data loading to use KV API

📊 New API Endpoints:
- POST /api/venues/update - Update venue status
- GET /api/venues/update - Retrieve all venues
- POST /api/venues/init - Initialize venue data from CSV

🎯 Key Changes:
- Modified /api/venues/update/route.ts to use @vercel/kv
- Created /api/venues/init/route.ts for data initialization
- Updated loadVenueData() in csvLoader.ts to use KV API
- Added @vercel/kv package dependency

📝 Setup Requirements:
- Install Vercel CLI: npm install -g vercel
- Create KV database: vercel kv create
- Link to project: vercel kv link
- Initialize data: POST /api/venues/init

✅ Benefits:
- Works on Vercel deployment
- Real-time venue status updates
- Scalable Redis-based storage
- Free tier available for small projects
- Maintains backward compatibility with CSV fallback

🔍 Troubleshooting:
- Added comprehensive setup guide in VERCEL_SETUP.md
- Environment variables configuration
- Alternative solutions (Supabase, Cloud Storage)
- Step-by-step deployment instructions

This resolves the venue status update issue on Vercel deployment! 🚀
